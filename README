libqmail is a library of general purpose APIs extracted from Dan
Bernstein's software, reimplemented and covered by the GNU General
Public License Version 3.

Many of the functions implemented here have since been placed in the
public domain, so there are other sources to get this code (except for
my extensions obviously).

I also provide man pages for many functions, mostly extracted from Dan's
web documentation or documentation found in earlier versions of his
software. For some reason, he abandoned man pages in favor of HTML
recently.

The author can be reached under libqmail@indimail.org
