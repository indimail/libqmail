.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR subprintf ()
produce output according to a
.I format
as described below.
The function
.BR subprintf ()
write output to
.IR ssout ,
.BR substdio (3)
output
.IR stream ;
.BR snprintf (),
and
.BR vsnprintf ()
write to the character string
.IR str .
.PP
The functions
.BR snprintf ()
and
.BR vsnprintf ()
write at most
.I size
bytes (including the terminating null byte (\(aq\e0\(aq)) to
.IR str .

The function
.BR qsnprintf ()
pre-allocates
.I size
bytes, but re-allocates as many bytes required to accomodate the string
(including the terminating null byte (\(aq\e0\(aq)) in
.BR stralloc (3)
variable
.IR sa .
\fIsa.len\fR will be the number of bytes in the string.

The function
.BR qsprintf ()
allocates as many bytes required to accomodate the string
(including the terminating null byte (\(aq\e0\(aq)) in
.BR stralloc (3)
variable
.IR sa .
\fIsa.len\fR will be the number of bytes in the string.

All of these functions write the output under the control of a
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via
the variable-length argument facilities of
.BR stdarg (3))
are converted for output.
.PP
C99 and POSIX.1-2001 specify that the results are undefined if a call to
.BR snprintf (),
or
.BR vsnprintf ()
would cause copying to take place between objects that overlap
(e.g., if the target string array and one of the supplied input arguments
refer to the same buffer).
See NOTES.
.SS Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending
in its initial shift state, if any.
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary
characters (not
.BR % ),
which are copied unchanged to the output stream;
and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or
more subsequent arguments.
Each conversion specification is introduced by
the character
.BR % ,
and ends with a
.IR "conversion specifier" .
In between there may be (in this order) zero or more
.IR flags ,
an optional minimum
.IR "field width" ,
an optional
.I precision
and an optional
.IR "length modifier" .
.PP
The overall syntax of a conversion specification is:
.PP
.in +4n
.nf
%[$][flags][width][.precision][length modifier]conversion
.fi
.in
.PP
The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the
conversion specifier.
By default, the arguments are used in the order
given, where each \(aq*\(aq (see
.I "Field width"
and
.I Precision
below) and each conversion specifier asks for the next
argument (and it is an error if insufficiently many arguments are given).
One can also specify explicitly which argument is taken,
at each place where an argument is required, by writing "%m$" instead
of \(aq%\(aq and "*m$" instead of \(aq*\(aq,
where the decimal integer \fIm\fP denotes
the position in the argument list of the desired argument, indexed starting
from 1.
Thus,
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
subprintf(ssout, "%*d", width, num);
.EE
.in
.PP
and
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
subprintf(ssout, "%2$*1$d", width, num);
.EE
.in
.PP
are equivalent.
The second style allows repeated references to the
same argument.
The C99 standard does not include the style using \(aq$\(aq,
which comes from the Single UNIX Specification.
If the style using
\(aq$\(aq is used, it must be used throughout for all conversions taking an
argument and all width and precision arguments, but it may be mixed
with "%%" formats, which do not consume an argument.
There may be no
gaps in the numbers of arguments specified using \(aq$\(aq; for example, if
arguments 1 and 3 are specified, argument 2 must also be specified
somewhere in the format string.
.PP
For some numeric conversions a radix character ("decimal point") or
thousands' grouping character is used.
The actual character used
depends on the
.B LC_NUMERIC
part of the locale.
(See
.BR setlocale (3).)
The POSIX locale
uses \(aq.\(aq as radix character, and does not have a grouping character.
Thus,
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
subprintf(ssout, "%\(aq.2f", 1234567.89);
.EE
.in
.PP
results in "1234567.89" in the POSIX locale, in "1234567,89" in the
nl_NL locale, and in "1.234.567,89" in the da_DK locale.
.SS Flag characters
The character % is followed by zero or more of the following flags:
.TP
.B #
The value should be converted to an "alternate form".
For
.B o
conversions, the first character of the output string is made zero
(by prefixing a 0 if it was not zero already).
For
.B x
and
.B X
conversions, a nonzero result has the string "0x" (or "0X" for
.B X
conversions) prepended to it.
For
.BR a ,
.BR A ,
.BR e ,
.BR E ,
.BR f ,
.BR F ,
.BR g ,
and
.B G
conversions, the result will always contain a decimal point, even if no
digits follow it (normally, a decimal point appears in the results of those
conversions only if a digit follows).
For
.B g
and
.B G
conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the result as they would
otherwise be.
For other conversions, the result is undefined.
.TP
.B \&0
The value should be zero padded.
For
.BR d ,
.BR i ,
.BR o ,
.BR u ,
.BR x ,
.BR X ,
.BR a ,
.BR A ,
.BR e ,
.BR E ,
.BR f ,
.BR F ,
.BR g ,
and
.B G
conversions, the converted value is padded on the left with zeros rather
than blanks.
If the
.B \&0
and
.B \-
flags both appear, the
.B \&0
flag is ignored.
If a precision is given with a numeric conversion
.RB ( d ,
.BR i ,
.BR o ,
.BR u ,
.BR x ,
and
.BR X ),
the
.B \&0
flag is ignored.
For other conversions, the behavior is undefined.
.TP
.B \-
The converted value is to be left adjusted on the field boundary.
(The default is right justification.)
The converted value is padded on the right with blanks, rather
than on the left with blanks or zeros.
A
.B \-
overrides a
.B \&0
if both are given.
.TP
.B \(aq \(aq
(a space) A blank should be left before a positive number
(or empty string) produced by a signed conversion.
.TP
.B +
A sign (+ or \-) should always be placed before a number produced by a signed
conversion.
By default, a sign is used only for negative numbers.
A
.B +
overrides a space if both are used.
.PP
The five flag characters above are defined in the C99 standard.
The Single UNIX Specification specifies one further flag character.
.TP
.B \(aq
For decimal conversion
.RB ( i ,
.BR d ,
.BR u ,
.BR f ,
.BR F ,
.BR g ,
.BR G )
the output is to be grouped with thousands' grouping characters
if the locale information indicates any.
(See
.BR setlocale (3).)
Note that many versions of
.BR gcc (1)
cannot parse this option and will issue a warning.
(SUSv2 did not
include \fI%\(aqF\fP, but SUSv3 added it.)
.PP
glibc 2.2 adds one further flag character.
.TP
.B I
For decimal integer conversion
.RB ( i ,
.BR d ,
.BR u )
the output uses the locale's alternative output digits, if any.
For example, since glibc 2.2.3 this will give Arabic-Indic digits
in the Persian ("fa_IR") locale.
.\" outdigits keyword in locale file
.SS Field width
An optional decimal digit string (with nonzero first digit) specifying
a minimum field width.
If the converted value has fewer characters
than the field width, it will be padded with spaces on the left
(or right, if the left-adjustment flag has been given).
Instead of a decimal digit string one may write "*" or "*m$"
(for some decimal integer \fIm\fP) to specify that the field width
is given in the next argument, or in the \fIm\fP-th argument, respectively,
which must be of type
.IR int .
A negative field width is taken as a \(aq\-\(aq flag followed by a
positive field width.
In no case does a nonexistent or small field width cause truncation of a
field; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field width, the
field is expanded to contain the conversion result.
.SS Precision
An optional precision, in the form of a period (\(aq.\(aq)  followed by an
optional decimal digit string.
Instead of a decimal digit string one may write "*" or "*m$"
(for some decimal integer \fIm\fP) to specify that the precision
is given in the next argument, or in the \fIm\fP-th argument, respectively,
which must be of type
.IR int .
If the precision is given as just \(aq.\(aq, the precision is taken to
be zero.
A negative precision is taken as if the precision were omitted.
This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for
.BR d ,
.BR i ,
.BR o ,
.BR u ,
.BR x ,
and
.B X
conversions, the number of digits to appear after the radix character for
.BR a ,
.BR A ,
.BR e ,
.BR E ,
.BR f ,
and
.B F
conversions, the maximum number of significant digits for
.B g
and
.B G
conversions, or the maximum number of characters to be printed from a
string for
.B s
and
.B S
conversions.
.SS Length modifier
Here, "integer conversion" stands for
.BR d ,
.BR i ,
.BR o ,
.BR u ,
.BR x ,
or
.B X
conversion.

(ell-ell).
A following integer conversion corresponds to a

.PP
SUSv3 specifies all of the above,
except for those modifiers explicitly noted as being nonstandard extensions.
SUSv2 specified only the length modifiers
.B h
(in
.BR hd ,
.BR hi ,
.BR ho ,
.BR hx ,
.BR hX ,
.BR hn )
and
.B l
(in
.BR ld ,

.BR ln ,
.BR lc ,
.BR ls )
and
.B L
(in
.BR Le ,
.BR LE ,
.BR Lf ,
.BR Lg ,
.BR LG ).
.PP
As a nonstandard extension, the GNU implementations treats
.B ll
and
.B L
as synonyms, so that one can, for example, write
.BR llg
(as a synonym for the standards-compliant
.BR Lg )
and
.BR Ld
(as a synonym for the standards compliant
.BR lld ).
Such usage is nonportable.
.\"
.SS Conversion specifiers
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR d ", " i
The
.I int
argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits
that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is
padded on the left with zeros.
The default precision is 1.
When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.
.TP
.BR o ", " u ", " x ", " X
The
.I "unsigned int"
argument is converted to unsigned octal
.RB ( o ),
unsigned decimal
.RB ( u ),
or unsigned hexadecimal
.RB ( x
and
.BR X )
notation.
The letters
.B abcdef
are used for
.B x
conversions; the letters
.B ABCDEF
are used for
.B X
conversions.
The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits
that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is
padded on the left with zeros.
The default precision is 1.
When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.
.TP
.BR e ", " E
The
.I double
argument is rounded and converted in the style
.RB [\-]d \&. ddd e \(+-dd
where there is one digit (which is nonzero if the argument is nonzero)
before the decimal-point character and the number
of digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing,
it is taken as 6; if the precision is zero, no decimal-point character
appears.
An
.B E
conversion uses the letter
.B E
(rather than
.BR e )
to introduce the exponent.
The exponent always contains at least two
digits; if the value is zero, the exponent is 00.
.TP
.BR f ", " F
The
.I double
argument is rounded and converted to decimal notation in the style
.RB [\-]ddd \&. ddd,
where the number of digits after the decimal-point character is equal to
the precision specification.
If the precision is missing, it is taken as
6; if the precision is explicitly zero, no decimal-point character appears.
If a decimal point appears, at least one digit appears before it.
.IP
(SUSv2 does not know about
.B F
and says that character string representations for infinity and NaN
may be made available.
SUSv3 adds a specification for
.BR F .
The C99 standard specifies "[\-]inf" or "[\-]infinity"
for infinity, and a string starting with "nan" for NaN, in the case of
.B f
conversion, and "[\-]INF" or "[\-]INFINITY" or "NAN" in the case of
.B F
conversion.)
.TP
.BR g ", " G
The
.I double
argument is converted in style
.B f
or
.B e
(or
.B F
or
.B E
for
.B G
conversions).
The precision specifies the number of significant digits.
If the precision is missing, 6 digits are given; if the precision is zero,
it is treated as 1.
Style
.B e
is used if the exponent from its conversion is less than \-4 or greater
than or equal to the precision.
Trailing zeros are removed from the
fractional part of the result; a decimal point appears only if it is
followed by at least one digit.
.TP
.BR a ", " A
(C99; not in SUSv2, but added in SUSv3)
For
.B a
conversion, the
.I double
argument is converted to hexadecimal notation (using the letters abcdef)
in the style
.RB [\-] 0x h \&. hhhh p \(+-d;
for
.B A
conversion the prefix
.BR 0X ,
the letters ABCDEF, and the exponent separator
.B P
is used.
There is one hexadecimal digit before the decimal point,
and the number of digits after it is equal to the precision.
The default precision suffices for an exact representation of the value
if an exact representation in base 2 exists
and otherwise is sufficiently large to distinguish values of type
.IR double .
The digit before the decimal point is unspecified for nonnormalized
numbers, and nonzero but otherwise unspecified for normalized numbers.
The exponent always contains at least one
digit; if the value is zero, the exponent is 0.
.TP
.B c
If no
.B l
modifier is present, the
.I int
argument is converted to an
.IR "unsigned char" ,
and the resulting character is written.
If an
.B l
modifier is present, the
.I wint_t
(wide character) argument is converted to a multibyte sequence by a call
to the
.BR wcrtomb (3)
function, with a conversion state starting in the initial state, and the
resulting multibyte string is written.
.TP
.B s
If no
.B l
modifier is present: the
.I "const char\ *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer
to a string).
Characters from the array are written up to (but not
including) a terminating null byte (\(aq\e0\(aq);
if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified
are written.
If a precision is given, no null byte need be present;
if the precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of the
array, the array must contain a terminating null byte.
.IP
If an
.B l
modifier is present: the
.I "const wchar_t\ *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of wide characters.
Wide characters from the array are converted to multibyte characters
(each by a call to the
.BR wcrtomb (3)
function, with a conversion state starting in the initial state before
the first wide character), up to and including a terminating null
wide character.
The resulting multibyte characters are written up to
(but not including) the terminating null byte.
If a precision is
specified, no more bytes than the number specified are written, but
no partial multibyte characters are written.
Note that the precision
determines the number of
.I bytes
written, not the number of
.I wide characters
or
.IR "screen positions" .
The array must contain a terminating null wide character, unless a
precision is given and it is so small that the number of bytes written
exceeds it before the end of the array is reached.
.TP
.B C
(Not in C99 or C11, but in SUSv2, SUSv3, and SUSv4.)
Synonym for
.BR lc .
Don't use.
.TP
.B S
(Not in C99 or C11, but in SUSv2, SUSv3, and SUSv4.)
Synonym for
.BR ls .
Don't use.
.TP
.B p
The
.I "void\ *"
pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal (as if by
.B %#x
or
.BR %#lx ).
.TP
.B n
The number of characters written so far is stored into the integer
pointed to by the corresponding argument.
That argument shall be an
.IR "int\ *" ,
or variant whose size matches the (optionally)
supplied integer length modifier.
No argument is converted.
(This specifier is not supported by the bionic C library.)
The behavior is undefined if the conversion specification includes
any flags, a field width, or a precision.
.TP
.B m
(Glibc extension; supported by uClibc and musl.)
Print output of
.IR strerror(errno) .
No argument is required.
.TP
.B %
A \(aq%\(aq is written.
No argument is converted.
The complete conversion
specification is \(aq%%\(aq.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters
printed pluse one (including the null byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
The functions
.BR snprintf ()
and
.BR vsnprintf ()
do not write more than
.I size
bytes (including the terminating null byte (\(aq\e0\(aq)).
If the output was truncated due to this limit, then the return value
is the number of characters (excluding the terminating null byte)
which would have been written to the final string if enough space
had been available.
Thus, a return value of
.I size
or more means that the output was truncated.
(See also below under NOTES.)
.PP
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH NOTES
Some programs imprudently rely on code such as the following
.PP
    sprintf(buf, "%s some further text", buf);
.PP
to append text to
.IR buf .
However, the standards explicitly note that the results are undefined
if source and destination buffers overlap when calling
.BR snprintf (),
and
.BR vsnprintf ().
.\" http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7075
Depending on the version of
.BR gcc (1)
used, and the compiler options employed, calls such as the above will
.B not
produce the expected results.
.PP
The glibc implementation of the functions
.BR snprintf ()
and
.BR vsnprintf ()
conforms to the C99 standard, that is, behaves as described above,
since glibc version 2.1.
Until glibc 2.0.6, they would return \-1
when the output was truncated.

.SH BUGS
.PP
Code such as
.BI subprintf(ssout, foo );
often indicates a bug, since
.I foo
may contain a % character.
If
.I foo
comes from untrusted user input, it may contain \fB%n\fP, causing the
.BR printf ()
call to write to memory and creating a security hole.

.SH EXAMPLES
To print
.I Pi
to five decimal places:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
#include <math.h>
#include <qprintf.h>
subprintf(ssout, "pi = %.5f\en", 4 * atan(1.0));
.EE
.in
.PP
To print a date and time in the form "Sunday, July 3, 10:02",
where
.I weekday
and
.I month
are pointers to strings:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
#include <qprintf.h>
subprintf(ssout, "%s, %s %d, %.2d:%.2d\en",
        weekday, month, day, hour, min);
.EE
.in
.PP
Many countries use the day-month-year order.
Hence, an internationalized version must be able to print
the arguments in an order specified by the format:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
#include <qprintf.h>
subprintf(ssout, format,
        weekday, month, day, hour, min);
.EE
.in
.PP
where
.I format
depends on locale, and may permute the arguments.
With the value:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
"%1$s, %3$d. %2$s, %4$d:%5$.2d\en"
.EE
.in
.PP
one might obtain "Sonntag, 3. Juli, 10:02".
.PP
To allocate a sufficiently large string and print into it
(code correct for both glibc 2.0 and glibc 2.1):
.PP
.EX
#include <qprintf.h>
#include <alloc.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

char *
make_message(const char *fmt, ...)
{
    int n = 0;
    size_t size = 0;
    char *p = NULL;
    va_list ap;

    /* Determine required size. */

    va_start(ap, fmt);
    n = vsnprintf(p, size, fmt, ap);
    va_end(ap);

    if (n < 0)
        return NULL;

    size = (size_t) n + 1;      /* One extra byte for \(aq\e0\(aq */
    p = alloc(size);
    if (p == NULL)
        return NULL;

    va_start(ap, fmt);
    n = vsnprintf(p, size, fmt, ap);
    va_end(ap);

    if (n < 0) {
        alloc_free(p);
        return NULL;
    }

    return p;
}
.EE
.PP
The above example can be better handled with just one call to qsnprintf(3)
.PP
.PP
If truncation occurs in glibc versions prior to 2.0.6, this is treated as an
error instead of being handled gracefully.
